__**Easy Installation**__

Clone this repository by going:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WWEMGamer2/RapidChatApp.git --quiet; echo "Finished";
```

It should say "Finished" in the Terminal after it is done.
CD and run the app by going:

```bash
cd ./RapidChatApp/main;echo "Starting...";python3 ui.py &
```

And a window should pop up!
> :red_square: If you are getting errors in the Terminal, be sure to have installed all the dependencies that make it work.

__**Very Easy Installation: program will need administrative privilages**__

Download the latest release file and open up your Terminal at the root directory you downloaded it to.
The executable will setup everything for you.
Execute in your Terminal by going:
```bash
chmod +x ./rapidchat-install;./rapidchat-install/install;
```

If it all works out correctly, you should see a screen after the installation that has the application open.
Our installation is all done!
